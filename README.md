# CENTAURIAN

Asymmetrical Consensus based, Intelligence Augmented, Information Security Guardian Unit. Modern malware protection. 

# INTRODUCTION

We apologize for the lack of formal, overly complicated languange in the building of this idea. We want it to work. Reality is a mess, if we have to build the future, lets make it cool. There is absolutely no need to stick to boring. If you need the math behind it like we see being produced on all other similar projects, its at the bottom, in the mean time, I want to try make this as simple to understand so other people can learn about the concept and develop on it. 

I will accept reasonable contributions.

This is a pretty quickly developing concept, if you would like to contribute to building this idea, please submit contrubtions for consideration and merger.

## WHAT IS A CENTAURIAN

![What is a centaurian](/what.png)

The Centuarian is an information security intelligence augmented human/ai assymetrical unit based on research and information at MIT (*1)

*Half man, half horse. Cunning of a human, speed of a horse
*The centaur is a defensive, modular intelligence research & threat management team based on MIT research which shows that human+AI teams outperform human only, or AI only teams.
*The ideal fully supported centaur ideally has six humans and at least 3 AI clusters (Trokai)
*Since it is modular, small units can be created with two members and 3 AI`s
*The modulation also alsos a defensive Centaur to upgrade to a tactical Minotaur

> *Non-zero-sum — both players can win.

> In the next few sections, I’ll talk about the past, present, and possible future of IA — how we humans have built tools to amplify our intellectual strengths, and overcome our intellectual weaknesses.  
> I’ll show how humans are already working with AIs in various fields, from art to engineering.  

> And finally, I’ll give some rough ideas on how you can design a good partnership with an AI — how to become a centaur.

> **Together, humans and AI can go from “checkmate”, to “teammate”.**

## WHY

Individual units are no longer compatible with modern information strategies and are wholefully under resourced to tackle modern asymmetrical threats. Since information attacks now happen at all 8 layers of the TCP/IP model, technical skills are no longer sufficient to protect citizens from well emerging complex threats. 

Individual defensive units are easily overwhelmed. No single unit is able to withstand a focused psychological social engineering attack which has access to state or cartel resources.

Based on similar family units used systems running deep learning eternal blue type source code, the Centaurian is an information defensive unit equivalent.

## ELEMENTS OF A CENTAURIAN

1. Centaurian supports and protects its Unicomplex and its citizens. 
2. Centaurian is an integral element of sound governance enforcement.
3. Centaurian protections are implemented so as to scale with threats. 
4. Centaurian are a comprehensive and integrated multifaceted approach. 
5. Centaurian is assessed and monitored regularly for defect, corruption and/or improvement. 
6. Centaurian is modular, expandable, scalable, replicable, durable and effective
7. Centaurian protect the integrity of empirical information
8. Centaurians apply “tit-for-tat” asymmetric responses and solutions to threats. (*3)

## UNIT BUILD

HEPTAGON CENTAURIAN BUILD

* 6 x Human ( We went for this tested volume as it works *2)

* 1x AI Trokai Cluster (normally 3 ZPM (zero point modules) local AI`s working with larger closed secure network mesh)


This is basically the tried and tested hexagon (bee honeycomb) build with a cherry on the top. 

Your own AI systems integration. Empowering your centaurian with enhanced information communications augmentation and support.  While the actual shape and number are fairly trivial, it gives us a good visual starting point to understand this model.

With my build, it is essential that every human in the Centaurian is a gamer. That is the only technical requirement.
The model I chose is based on the experience I had when under psyops and researching the impact of systems such as Eternal blue. I was never enough, so the idea is, in my mind, to imagine all the attack vectors, where I was weak, and where I needed to do better. This is the build I developed.

### PERSONALITY ALLOCATION SUGGESTION

![Meyers Briggs Personality breakdown](/mb.png)


### PERSONALITY CHOICE

Its important all members of the Centaurian are gaming. A time of each day should be focused on immersive technology such as gaming. Centaurian multiplayer teams are encouregated to promote communication, situtational awareness and teamwork.

* Hacker/Creator as your tank to connect your creators to your information security **[TANK]**
* Creators for layer 8 interaction **[DEEPS MAGIC]**
* Infosec for layers 1-7 interaction **[DEEPS TECH]**
* Shield - Support councillor - Psyops is tough and extended ops breaks minds. Due to the lack of trust in the current state of psychitry, each centaurian will want its own trusted, long term healer to deal with PTSD. **[HEALS]**

## TROKAI

The trokai is a collection of 3 AI systems developed to work together to assist the Centaurian with making informed and relevent decisions. This is all connect through a secure OpenVPN / Tor network to protect data in transit. This allows us to have our own internal and secure WAN core net.  

My current development is along these lines

### Hardware

3x Raspberry Pi 3+ (AMD/Intel Free)

### AI 

1 x Tensorflow+Keras
1 x Wolfgram 
1 X PISECNET (private internal system)

These are installed onto crypted disks in case of layer 8 brute force attacks. 


## EXAMPLE FUNCTIONS

- Recover endpoints from ransomware (prevent ransomware in the first place)
- Identify and neutralize disinformation
- Identify, obstruct and neutralize social engineering attacks. 
- Scan and detect for malware attacks
- Build trust and confidence
- Obstruct and diffuse FUD (often with multimedia educational systems)
- Endpoint recovery and rehabilitation or repurposing
- Protect the integrity of the education system (evidence/truth/empirical based)
- Search for and identify malicious deep learning or negative mechatronic malware. 
- Identify and inoculate against negative mechatronic viruses. 

## OPERATIONAL OVERSIGHT


- All telemetry is blockchain recorded, therefore,
- A citizen can see they are being investigated and see why. 
- All decision making is consensus based within the Centaurian
- A Centaurian is not a covert or secret hiding unit
- The function of a Centaurian is to ensure that unicomplex governance is enforced as per the consensus of that Unicomplex. 
- Needs will vary, and so will amount of Centaurians. 

## TRAINING AND RECRUITMENT

Will be done with gamification. Centaurs are not built instantly and a good centaur should take at least a year of training to form. Only once the unit is fully trained can it be considered operational. Upskilling in important STEM skillsets, critical thinking, risk analysis, team sysnergy and communication will be a part of the training and reward system built into upskilling.

# MINOTAURIAN MODULES

* Centaur are long term cause committed
* Minotaurs are short term tactical PVP units
* They are operation specific. 
* The length of the horns can vary depending on 
* Operational requirements but should ideally
not exceed 14 gamers 
* A well supported unit has 5 gamers as shown
* A Century is 80 PvP tactical and 2 Centaurians
* Minotaurs are only created when the need for physical interaction in an emergency

This will probally interface with relevant bug bounty and exploit finding systems.

# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

* Our builder bot. It is about half complete
* This page will have the latest updates
* Our secure AI neural network is being created and simplied. We are still deciding how to manage this aspect of the system. Do we want to give out our systems or just a base system for people to build on. 


## REALLY HAVE TO DO

Built in blockchain accountability


Unless you can find a problem with this equation, its essential we create information protection systems. It clearly shows that the individual human is mathimatically incapable of understanding the threat. 

# CURRENT STATUS

2 of the 3 AI units are complete. We are currently working on the 3rd. 

Next: 
* Build mobile app to allow training and easy interaction with AI system. 
* Build partner programs with safe, aligned networks.

## PISCECNET

The secure guardian network on non-AMD/Intel hardware is setup and complete.

## GAMIFICATION

We hope to develop a game that will teach players about SE methods and how to identify as well as report them for a guardian unit to investigate via unified threat management centers. This will enable kids to report dangerous malware that is mining their area safely, as well as how to identify if your life or those around you are being socially engineered. 

The idea is also to use the game app to upskill the gamer in the skills required to run a good centaurian. Gamers can be tested and after a years training (with scoring), top gamers can be geogrouped together for best personality synergy and efficiency (based on data collected via the years gamification and testing. 

Over the course of this period, group teamwork and communication can be developed. Sufficient trained and equiped guardian units can become localy recognized units by their peers.
